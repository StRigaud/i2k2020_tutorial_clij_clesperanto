This protocol documents an image data flow using CLIJx-Assistant.

Generator version: 0.4.0.8

We start our image data flow with image1.
 
Afterwards, we applied "Copy" on image1, and got a new image out, image2.
 
As the next step we applied "Gaussian Blur2D" on image2, and got a
new image out, image3.
In order to do so, we used the parameters sigma_x = 16.0 and
sigma_y = 16.0.
 
As the next step we applied "Greater" on image2 and image3, and got
a new image out, image4.
 
Then, we applied "Connected Components Labeling Box" on image4, and
got a new image out, image5.
