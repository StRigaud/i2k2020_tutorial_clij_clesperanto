# Exercise 6: Deconvolution + Segmentation

Setup a workflow for deconvolving and segmenting letters in [convolved_stack.tif](https://github.com/clEsperanto/i2k2020_tutorial_clij_clesperanto/blob/master/exercise6/convolved_stack.tif).
Use the [perfect_psf_stack.tif](https://github.com/clEsperanto/i2k2020_tutorial_clij_clesperanto/blob/master/exercise6/perfect_psf_stack.tif) and blur it using a Gaussian blur to tune your point spread function.
